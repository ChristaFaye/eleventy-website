            %p Hi! I'm <i>Christa Faye Reyes</i>. I am borne Filipino, currently living in Canada as an international student.

            %p I am an <em>application support analyst</em> for almost 7 years, mostly for multi-national companies before I decided to take <em>Web Design and Development</em> at Humber College. I believe that this certificate will make way for my long term goal of being a Full Stack Developer. With my back-end support experience, I wanted to level up my skills by studying web development formally. Before, I only self-taught myself about HTML, CSS, C#, ASP.Net, APIs, etc. Having this degree gives me confidence that I can compete win the market where Full Stack Developers are sought after.

            %p Aside from my technical background, I had a volunteer experience since 2013 which stirred my passion for design. I volunteer in creating pubmats, audio-visual presentations, editing podcasts and coordinating events. That is when I started to love design.
